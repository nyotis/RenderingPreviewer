1. clone repository

git clone $PATH/framebuffer_test https://github.com/nyiotis/Arnold_to_RV_FrameBuffer


2. build libraries dependencies [1] 

git submodule init
git submodule update

Check the command line output to make sure the libraries are correctly built.


3. built framebuffer

scons debug=1 with-arnold=$ARNOLD_PATH -j2


4. set RV version TO 4.0.10 and install the MayaRender Mode RV package

setrv 4.0.10
export RV_SUPPORT_PATH=PATH/framebuffer_test/rv

cd PATH/framebuffer_test/rv/mayarender_mode
./createpackage
cd ../
rvpkg -install ./Packages/mayarender-1.0.rvpkg

Fire-up RV and make sure you get a "Load Maya Render Mode loaded" in RV's console without any errors. 
If Maya Render Mode Menu doesn't show up in RV, go to Packages Tab under RV Preferences Window and make sure Maya Render Support is Installed and Loaded. 


5. set Arnold path so that dynamic library gets picked at runtime
echo $ARNOLD_VERSION
export ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH=PATH/framebuffer_test/debug/x64


6. fire up maya 
  
Load one *.ma/*.mb scene to test the buffer

Execute the attached Python script in Maya's console. RVlive button should appear on the right of Arnold-to-Mplay in Maya. Hit RVlive and you should see a render of the scene in RV.

Set the Maya Port into the same one you opened earlier with the python script, say 4700. So set Port to 3700â€‹ under Maya Render Menu -> Configure in RV.
Now, you can trigger renders from RV directly: right click and pick Maya Render -> Render. Hit x, while in RV to see the Folder/Sources/Stacks structure

When executing the python script with a different port number, a new RVlive button will be generated.

Draw a region of interest (ROI) by dragging the middle mouse button in RV, while simultaneously hold the Shift button. A red rectangular region should appear, right-click and pick 
Maya Render -> Render Region.

Feel free to iterate with different scenes, image sizes. 
Any trouble/failure/success, do let me know.
